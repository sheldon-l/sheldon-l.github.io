## Just Wanna Try

- Python official website: <https://www.python.org/>
- Python tutorial in Chinese: <https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-install.html>
- Python pacakges: <https://pypi.org/>
- Matplotlib: <https://matplotlib.org/>
- IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or something else;
- Toolkit for DS: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (Jupyter notebook is a must);
- If you don't know how to start with these tools, please:
  - Search to see how other people do it.
  - Check the documentations on official website.

## A Better Way

### Tools

- VPN is a must if you are in China, because you need to search instructions in youtube or google frequently;
  - Option 1: <https://sunshare03.github.io/v2client> See if you can follow the instruction to install, then sent the email to get a route.
  - Option 2: Find other tools as possible as you can, but don't trust them too much, as soon as you can step over the Great Fire Wall, please buy a better VPN, such as <https://www.squirrelvpn.com/>

- Google chrome (Search in google at any time if you have something in doubt, also, an online IDE [colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) is hold by google);

### Tutorials For Python Beginners

- [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
- [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming)
- [Python Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/)
- [Play Ground - CheckIO](https://checkio.org/)

- Note: All the courses in the coursera are free, just choose `audit`(Pang Ting) when open the course. But if you need a certification, you still need to pay for the full course.
