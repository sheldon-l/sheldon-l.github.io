## Introduction to DevOps and SRE

### The Pre-DevOps Era (Before 2007)

- Releases = thriller movie
- Infrastructure is not flexive
- Continuous Integration was in a very nascent stage: Cruise Control, Hudson
- Monitoring: Nagios, didn't have a way to pull out the logs and centrally  manage it.

### Emergence of DevOps

- 2008

  - centralized configuration management system:
  - Puppet, mainly for laptops and desk tops.
  - containers for production systems.
  - Borg, orchestrator for containers
  - `cgroup` kernel offered a process resources isolation.
  - Linux Containers (lxc), built on top of cgroups and namespaces
  - Agile Systems Administrator Group

- 2009:

  - Cloud, such as AWS, including VPCs, the Elastic Block Stores... featured with autoscaling.
  - video "10+ dyploys per day" on youtube, talking about automation and infrustructure as code, improving the collabration between Dev and Ops.
