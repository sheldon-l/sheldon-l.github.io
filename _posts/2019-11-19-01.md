## Basic Syntax of Bash

- Linux provides a wide choice of shells; exactly what is available on the system is listed in `/etc/shells`.

- Examples of Shebang:

```c
#!/bin/csh
#!/bin/ksh
#!/bin/zsh
#!/usr/bin/python
```

### Shebang

- New file named `HelloWorld.sh`

```bash
cat << EOF > hello.sh
> #!/bin/bash
> echo "Hello, world"
> EOF
```

- Run in Command Lines:

```bash
bash hello.sh

# OR
chmod +x HelloWorld.sh
./HelloWorld.sh
```

### Variables

- `VARIABLE_NAME="Value"`

- `$VARIABLE_NAME` or `${VARIABLE_NAME}` if need to immediately precede or follow the variable with additional data.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
MY_SHELL = "bash"
echo "I like the $MY_SHELL shell."
echo "I am ${MY_SHELL}ing on my keyboard."
```

- Command substitution:
  - By enclosing the inner command in `$()`, which allows command nesting
  - By enclosing the inner command with backticks: ``` `` ```, which is deprecated in new scripts and commands

```bash
#!/bin/bash
SERVER_NAME=$(hostname)
echo "Running this script on ${SERVER_NAME}."
ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`
```

- Valid variable names can contain **letters, digits, and underscores**; can start with **letters, or underscores**

### Built-In Shell Commands

- Shell scripts execute sequences of commands and other types of statements. These commands can be:

  - Shell scripts or scripts from other interpreted languages, such as perl and Python.

  - Compiled applications are binary executable files, generally residing on the filesystem in well-known directories such as `/usr/bin`. Shell scripts always have access to applications such as `rm`, `ls`, `df`, `vi`, and `gzip`, which are programs compiled from lower level programming languages such as C.

  - `bash` has many built-in commands, which can only be used to display the output within a terminal shell or shell script. Sometimes, these commands have the same name as executable programs on the system, such as echo which can lead to subtle problems. `bash` built-in commands include `cd`,  `pwd`, `echo`, `read`, `logout`, `printf`, `let`, and `ulimit`. Thus, slightly different behavior can be expected from the built-in version of a command such as echo as compared to /bin/echo. A complete list of bash built-in commands can be found in the bash man page, or by simply typing `help` in terminal, as we review on the next page.

### Positional Prameters

Parameter | Meaning
`$0` | Script name
`$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. | First, second, third parameter, etc.
`$*` | All parameters
`$#` | Number of arguments
`$@` | from `$1` to the last one

- Example: new file `archive_user.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Executing script: $0"
echo "Archiving user: $1"

# Lock the account
passwd -l $1

# Create an archive of the home directory
tar cf /archives/${1}.tart.gz/home/${1}
```

```bash
./archive_user.sh user_name
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Exacuting script: $0"

for USER in $@
do
     echo "Executing script: $0"
     echo "Archiving user: $USER"

     # Lock the account
     passwd -l $USER

     # Create an archive of the home directory
     tar cf /archives/${USER}.tart.gz /home/${USER}
done
```

```bash
./archive_user.sh user_name_1 user_name_2 user_name_n
```

### Getting User Input

- `read -p "PROMPT" VARIABLE_NAME`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a user name：" USER
echo "Archiving user: $USER"

passwd -l $USER
tar cf /achives/${USER}.tar.gz /home/${USER}
```

## Exit Statuses and Return Codes

### "`$?`"

- `$?` contains the return code of the previously executed command

```bash
HOST = "google.com"
ping -c 1 $HOST
RETURN_CODE = $?

if ["$RETURN_CODE" -ne "0"]
then
     echo "$HOST unreachable"
fi
```

### The `exit` Command

- Control the exit status of shell script by using `exit $NUMBER` where the `NUMBER` is from `0` to `255`

```bash
HOST="google.com"
ping -c 1 $HOST
if [ "$?" -ne "0" ]
then
  echo "HOST unreachable."
  exit 1
fi
```

## Functions

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function fuction_name(){
     commands...
}
# OR
fuction_name(){
     commands...
}

# call function
function_name
```

## Arithmetic Expressions

- Arithmetic expressions can be evaluated in the following three ways (spaces are important!):

  - `expr`, a standard but somewhat deprecated program:

  ```bash
  expr 8 /* 8
  echo $(expr 8 /* 8)  # can not tell *, should use /*
  ```

  - `$((...))`, the built-in shell format. In modern shell scripts, `expr` is better replaced with `var=$((...))`:

  ```bash
  echo $((x+1))
  ```

  - `let`:

  ```bash
  let x=( 1 + 2 ); echo $x
  ```

## String Manipulation

```bash
${#string}          # the length of string in the variable myLen1.
${string:0:n}       # slicing
${string#*.}        # extract all characters in a string after a dot (.)

NAME=Eddie.Haskel
first=${NAME:0:5} ; echo "first name = $first"
last=${NAME#*.} ; echo "last name = $last"
```

## The Constructs

### The test and `if` statement

- You can use the test statment and the `if` statement to test for file attributes, such as:
  - File or directory existence
  - Read or write permission
  - Executable permission.

- Test for different conditions and act accordingly: `[[ CONDITION (is True) ]]`

```bash
# Files and directorys
[[ -e file ]]      # True if exists
[[ -d file ]]      # True if is a directory
[[ -f file ]]      # True if exists and is a regular file (i.e. not a symbolic link, device node, directory, etc.)
[[ -s file ]]      # True if exists and s of non-zero size.

[[ -r file ]]      # True if is readable
[[ -w file ]]      # True if is writable
[[ -x file ]]      # True if is executable
[[ -g file ]]      # True if the file has sgid set.
[[ -u file ]]      # True if the file has suid set.

# Strings Testing
[ -z string ]         # True if is empty
[ -n string ]         # True if is not empty4
# note if $str1 is empty, the test [ -z $str1 ] would fail
#                              but [[ -z $str1 ]] succeeds

[[ string1 == string2 ]]
[[ string1 ！= string2 ]]
[[ string1 > string2 ]] # the sorting order of string1 and string2

# Numerical Tests
[[ arg1 -eq arg2 ]]     # =
[[ arg1 -ne arg2 ]]     # !=
[[ arg1 -lt arg2 ]]     # <
[[ arg1 -le arg2 ]]     # <=
[[ arg1 -gt arg2 ]]     # >
[[ arg1 -ge arg2 ]]     # >=
```

- `if` statement:

```bash
if [ CONDITION ]
then
  commands...
elif [ CONDITION ]
then
  commands...
else
  commands...
fi
```

- In modern scripts, you may see doubled brackets as in `[[ -f /etc/passwd ]]`. This is not an error. It is never wrong to do so and it avoids some subtle problems, such as referring to an empty environment variable without surrounding it in double quotes.

  - `[[ ]]` works even without the quotes
  - `[[ -z $str ]]` even succeed if the string is zero length! Should use `[ -z $str ]`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
MY_SHELL="bash"

if [ "$MY_SHELL"="bash" ]  # it's a best practice to enclose variables in quotes
# to prevent some unexpected side effects
# when performing conditional tests
then
  echo "You seem to like the bash shell."
elif [ "$MY_SHELL"="csh" ]
then
  echo "You seem to like the csh shell."
else
  echo "You don't seem to like the bash or csh shells."
fi
```

### AND and OR (`&&` and `||`)

- `command_1 && command_2`:

  - do command_1, `if ["$?" -eq "0"]` then do command_2

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST = "google.com"
ping -c 1 $HOST && echo "$HOST reachable"
```

- `command_1 || command_2`:

  - do command_1, `if ["$?" -ne "0"]` then do command_2

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST = "google.com"
ping -c 1 $HOST || echo "$HOST unreachable"
```

### Chain Commands Together

- If chain commands together on a single line by separating with a semicolon "`;`", the semicolon doesn't  perform exit status checking, nomatter if the previous command faild or successed, the command following a semicolon will always get executed.

```bash
make ; make install ; make clean

if [[ CONDITION1 ]] ; then do_commands
elif [[ CONDITION2 ]] ; then do_commands
else
  do_commands
fi
```

- However, you may want to abort subsequent commands when an earlier one fails. You can do this using the && (and) operator as in:

```bash
make && make install && make clean
[[ CONDITION1 ]] && [[ CONDITION2 ]] && do_commands
```

If the first command fails, the second one will never be executed. A final refinement is to use the || (or) operator, as in:

```bash
cat file1 || cat file2 || cat file3
```

### The `case` Statement

- Below are some of the advantages of using the case statement:

  - It is easier to read and write.
  - It is a good alternative to nested, multi-level `if-then-else-fi` code blocks.
  - It enables you to compare a variable against several values at once.
  - It reduces the complexity of a program.

```bash
case expression in
   pattern1) execute commands;;
   pattern2) execute commands;;
   pattern3) execute commands;;
   pattern4) execute commands;;
   * )       execute some default commands or nothing ;;
esac

#!/bin/bash
echo "Do you want to destroy your entire file system?"
read response

case "$response" in
  "yes" | "y" | "Yes" | "Y" )  echo "I hope you know what you are doing!"
                               echo "I am supposed to type: rm -rf /"
                               echo "But I refuse to let you commit suicide.";;
  "no" | "n" | "No" | "N" )    echo "You are smart! Aborting...";;
  * )                          echo "You have to say yes or no.";;
esac
exit 0
```

### The `for` statements

```bash
for VARIABLE in ITEM_1 ITEM_2 ITEM_n
do
     commands...
done
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
COLORS="red green blue"

for COLOR in $COLORS
do
     echo "Color: $COLOR"
done
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
PICTURES=$(ls *jpg)
DATE=$(date +%F)

for PICTURE in $PICTURES
do
     echo "Renaming '${PICTURE}' to '${DATE}-${PICTURE}'"
     mv ${PICTURE} ${DATE}-${PICTURE}
done
```

### The `while` statements

```bash
while [ condition is true ]
do
  commands
done

#!/bin/bash
n=$1
[ "$n" == "" ] && echo "Please give a number and try again" && exit 1

factorial=1 ; j=1

while [ $j -le $n ]
do
  factorial=$(( $factorial * $j ))
  j=$(( $j + 1 ))
done

echo "The factorial of $n, $n! = $factorial"
```

### Thi `until` statements

```bash
until [ condition is false ]
do
  commands
done

#!/bin/bash
n=$1
[ "$n" == "" ] && echo "Pleas give a number and try again" && exit 1

factorial=1 ; j=1

until [ $j -gt $n ]
do
  factorial=$(( $factorial * $j ))
  j=$(( $j + 1 ))
done

echo "The factorial of $n, $n! = $factorial"
```

## Debugging bash Scripts

- You can run a bash script in debug mode either by doing `bash -x ./script_file`
- Or bracketing parts of the script with `set -x` and `set +x`. It can debug only selected parts.

- The debug mode helps identify the error because:
  - It traces and prefixes each command with the + character.
  - It displays each command before executing it.

### Redirecting Errors to File and Screen

```bash
bash [script].sh 2> error.log  # because the File Descriptor of `stderr` is 2, see "file stream"
# default redirect File Descriptor is 1, so `>` will redirect to `stdout`, whose descriptor is 1.
```

## Scheduling Future Processes

```bash
$ at now + 2 days
at> cat file1.txt
at> <EOT>          # press Ctrl+D here


# CROND     #  driven by /etc/crontab (cron table), run every day/week/month...

crontab -e   # 0 10 * * * /tmp/myjob.sh
# OR
touch mycrontab
echo `0 10 * * * /tmp/myjob.sh` > mycrontab
crontab mycrontab

crontab -l  # list
crontab -r  # remove

touch /tmp/myjob.sh
echo '#!/bin/bash' > /tmp/myjob.sh
echo 'echo Hello I am running $0 at $(date)' >> /tmp/myjob.sh
chmod +x /tmp/myjob.sh


sleep [number]<s|m|h|d>      # suspends execution for at least the specified period of time
```

## Additional Useful Techniques

### Creating Temporary Files and Directories

- Temporary files (and directories) are meant to store data for a short time. Usually, one arranges it so that these files disappear when the program using them terminates.
- SICURITY: While you can also use touch to create a temporary file, in some circumstances *this may make it easy for hackers to gain access to your data. This is particularly true if the name and the file location of the temporary file are predictable.* The best practice is to create random and unpredictable filenames for temporary storage. One way to do this is with the `mktemp` utility.

```bash
# file
TEMP=$(mktemp /tmp/tempfile.XXXXXXXX)  # XXXXXXXX will be replaced by mktemp

# dir
TEMPDIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/tempdir.XXXXXXXX)
```

- SICURITY: Sloppiness in creation of temporary files can lead to real damage, either by accident or if there is a malicious actor.

```bash
# For example, if someone were to create a symbolic link from a known temporary file
# used by root to the `/etc/passwd` file, like this:
ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/tempfile

# There could be a big problem if a script run by root has a line in like this:
echo $VAR > /tmp/tempfile
# The password file will be overwritten by the temporary file contents.

# To prevent such a situation, make sure you randomize your temporary file names
# by replacing the above line with the following lines:
TEMP=$(mktemp /tmp/tempfile.XXXXXXXX)
echo $VAR > $TEMP
```

### Discarding Output with /dev/null

- Certain commands (like find) will produce voluminous amounts of output, which can overwhelm the console. To avoid this, we can redirect the large output to a special file (a device node) called `/dev/null`. This pseudofile is also called the "bit bucket" or "black hole".

- All data written to it is discarded and write operations never return a failure condition. Using the proper redirection operators, it can make the output disappear from commands that would normally generate output to `stdout` and/or `stderr`:

```bash
ls -lR /tmp > /dev/null  # only stdout will be dumped into /dev/null.

ls -lR /tmp >& /dev/null # both stdout and stderr will be dumped into /dev/null.
```

### Random Numbers and Data

- It is often useful to generate random numbers and other random data when performing tasks such as:

  - Performing security-related tasks
  - Reinitializing storage devices
  - Erasing and/or obscuring existing data
  - Generating meaningless data to be used for tests.

- Such random numbers can be generated by using the `$RANDOM` environment variable, which is derived from the Linux kernel’s built-in random number generator:
  - Some servers have hardware random number generators that take as input different types of noise signals, such as thermal noise and photoelectric effect. A transducer converts this noise into an electric signal, which is again converted into a digital number by an A-D converter. This number is considered random. However, most common computers do not contain such specialized hardware and, instead, rely on events created during booting to create the raw data needed.

  - Regardless of which of these two sources is used, the system maintains a so-called entropy pool of these digital numbers/random bits. Random numbers are created from this entropy pool.

  - The Linux kernel offers the `/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom` device nodes, which draw on the entropy pool to provide random numbers which are drawn from the estimated number of bits of noise in the entropy pool.

  - `/dev/random` is used where very high quality randomness is required, such as one-time pad or key generation, but it is relatively slow to provide values. `/dev/urandom` is faster and suitable (good enough) for most cryptographic purposes.

  - Furthermore, when the entropy pool is empty, `/dev/random` is blocked and does not generate any number until additional environmental noise (network traffic, mouse movement, etc.) is gathered, whereas `/dev/urandom` reuses the internal pool to produce more pseudo-random bits.

- Or by the OpenSSL library function, which uses the [FIPS140 (Federal Information Processing Standard)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2) algorithm to generate random numbers for encryption.
