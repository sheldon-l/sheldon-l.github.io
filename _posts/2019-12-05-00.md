## Manipulating Text Without Using an Editor

### `echo` and `cat`

- Create Files

```bash
# Opt 1.
echo line one > myfile
echo line two >> myfile
echo line three >> myfile

# Opt 2.
cat > [file]    # done with Ctrl+D
cat >> [file]

cat << EOF > [file]  # = `cat > [file] << EOF`
> line one
> line two
> line three
> EOF           # end with EOF
```

- Concatinate Files

```bash
<cat|tac> [filename]       # tac will backward output line by line
<cat|tac> [file1] [file2] > [newfile]
<cat|tac> [file] >> [existingfile]
```

- Show large files:

```bash
cat [file] | <less|more>
<less|more> [file]

<head|tail> -n 5 [file]
<head|tail> -5 [file]

tail -f somefile.log  # continually monitor new output in a growing log file
```

- Viewing Compressed Files

```bash
# gzip - z, bz2 - bz, xz - xz
<z|bz|xz>cat [file].gz
<z|bz|xz>less [file].gz
<z|bz|xz>more [file].gz
<z|bz|xz>grep -i [string] [file].gz
<z|bz|xz>diff file1.txt.gz file2.txt.gz
```

### `sed`

- NOTE: Linux users and administrators will write scripts using comprehensive scripting languages such as `Python` and `perl`, rather than use `sed` and `awk`. However, they use fewer system resources, and execute faster. There are situations (such as during booting the system) where a lot of time would be wasted using the more complicated tools, and the system may not even be able to run them. So, the simpler tools will always be needed.

- `sed` is a powerful text processing tool and is one of the oldest, earliest and most popular UNIX utilities. It is used to modify the contents of a file or input stream, usually placing the contents into a new file or output stream. Its name is an abbreviation for `Stream EDitor`.

```bash
sed -e [command_for_substitution] [file]   # e: specify multiple editing commands simultaneously at the command line.
sed -f [scriptfile] [file]

sed s/[pattern]/[replace_string]/ [file]             # Substitute first string occurrence in every line
sed s/[pattern]/[replace_string]/g [file]            # Substitute all string occurrence in every line
sed 1,3s/[pattern]/[replace_string]/g [file]         # Substitute all string occurrence in a range of line

sed -i s/[pattern]/[replace_string]/g [file]         # Save changes for string substitution in the same file, dangerous
sed s/[pattern]/[replace_string]/g [file1] > [file2] # Save changes for string substitution in a new file, safe

sed -e 's/01/JAN/' -e 's/02/FEB/' -e 's/03/MAR/' -e 's/04/APR/' -e 's/05/MAY/' \
    -e 's/06/JUN/' -e 's/07/JUL/' -e 's/08/AUG/' -e 's/09/SEP/' -e 's/10/OCT/' \
    -e 's/11/NOV/' -e 's/12/DEC/'

sed s/'\/sbin\/nologin'/'\/bin\/bash'/g /etc/passwd > /tmp/passwd_new
sed s:/sbin/nologin:/bin/bash:g /etc/passwd          # `:` = `/`
```

### `awk`

- `awk` is used to extract and then print specific contents of a file and is often used to construct reports. It was created at Bell Labs in the 1970s and derived its name from the last names of its authors: Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan. Features:
  - It is a powerful utility and interpreted programming language.
  - It is used to manipulate data files, retrieving, and processing text.
  - It works well with fields (containing a single piece of data, essentially a column) and records (a collection of fields, essentially a line in a file).

```bash
awk [command] [file]
awk -f [scriptfile] [file]

awk '{ print $0 }' /etc/passwd        # Print entire file
awk -F: '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd    # Print first field (column) of every line, separated by `:`
# F: specify a particular field separator character (`:` here)
awk -F ':' '{ print $1 $7 }' /etc/passwd # Print first and seventh field of every line, `:`
```

### File Manipulation Utilities

```bash
# sort
sort [file]                 # sort the lines
sort -r [file]              # sort the lines in reverse order
sort -k 3 [file]            # sort the lines by the 3rd field on each line instead of the beginning
cat [file1] [file2] | sort  # combine the two files, then sort the lines
sort [file1] [file2]        # same as above
sudo wc -l /var/log/*.log | sort -n # n: numeric sort

# uniq
sort [file1] [file2] | uniq > [file3]  # remove duplicate entries from multiple files at once
sort -u file1 file2 > file3            # same as above
uniq -c [file]

# paste
# to combine fields (such as name or phone number) from different files
# as well as combine lines from multiple files.
paste [file1] [file2]
paste -d, [file1] [file2]    # delimmiter is `,`
paste -d ',' [file1] [file2] # same as above
paste -s [file1] [file2]     # in a horizontal rather than vertical fashion

# join
# an enhanced version of paste, combine two files on a common field
join [file1] [file2]

# split
# to break up a file into equal-sized segments for easier viewing and manipulation.
# split breaks up a file into 1000-line segments by default
# and added prefix to the set of new files
wc -l [longfile]  # word count
split [longfile] [prefix]
```

### Regular Expressions and Search Patterns

- These regular expressions are different from the wildcards bash ([Linux 7 - Useful Commands For Debian-liked System](https://tane-rs.github.io/2019/10/29/00.html))

Search Patterns | Usage
-|-
`.` | Match any single character
`a|z` | Match `a` or `z`
`$` | Match end of string
`^` | Match beginning of string
`*` | Match preceding item 0 or more times

### `grep` and `strings`

```bash
grep [pattern] [filename]        # print all matching lines, pattern can be Regular Expressions
grep -v [pattern] [filename]     # Print all lines that do not match the pattern
grep [0-9] [filename]            # Print the lines that contain the numbers 0 through 9
grep -C 3 [pattern] [filename]   # Print context of 3 lines above and below the pattern
grep -n ftp /etc/services | grep -v tcp # n: print line number
grep -e ^ftp -e tcp$ /etc/services        # e: commands list

strings book1.xls | grep my_string  # search for the string my_string in a spreadsheet
```

### Miscellaneous Text Utilities

```bash
# this text is for testing
echo "{Hello world}" > hello
echo "This  is  \ta [test]." >> hello
echo "3 2 1 Go!" >> hello
cat hello


# tr: translate specified characters into other characters or to delete them
tr --help
# Options:
echo [input] | tr [SET1] [SET2]    # translat SET1 to SET2
echo [input] | tr -c [SET1] [SET2] # c: use the complements of SET1
echo [input] | tr -d [SET1] [SET2] # d: delete the charactors of SET1
echo [input] | tr -s [SET1] [SET2] # s: replace each sequence of a repeated character that is listed in the last SET
echo [input] | tr -t [SET1] [SET2] # t: first truncate SET1 to length of SET2

cat hello | tr a-z A-Z
cat hello | tr [:upper:] [:lower:]
cat hello | tr '{}' '()'
cat hello | tr [:space:] '\t'
cat hello | tr -s '\n' ' '
cat hello | tr -s [:space:]
cat hello | tr -d 't'
cat hello | tr -d [:digit:]
cat hello | tr -cd [:digit:]
cat hello | tr -cd [:print:]  # all printable charactor lincluding space

# Usage
echo [input] | [tr_command]
cat [inputfile] | [tr_command]
[tr_command] < [inputfile]
[tr_command] < [inputfile] > [outputfile]


# tee: one stream is displayed on the standard output and the other is saved to a file
sudo find /tmp -name "systemd*" | tee /tmp/tee_output
cat /tmp tee_output


# wc: word count
wc -lcw [file]             # lines, bytes, words, = `wc [file]`
wc [file1] [file2] [file2] # count 3 files at once
wc /var/log/*.log


# cut: manipulating column-based files and is designed to extract specific columns
# The default column separator is the tab character
ls -l | cut -d" " -f3   # delimiter " ", the 3rd columns
```

## Text Editors

### Nano

- The text terminal-based editor `nano`

```bash
nano [filename]
```

### Gedit

- A graphical editor `gedit` is part of the GNOME desktop system (`kwrite` and `kate` is associated with KDE).

```bash
gedit [filename]
```

### Vim

- Usually, the actual program installed on your system is `vim`, which stands for "Vi IMproved", and is aliased to the name `vi`.
- GNOME extends `vi` with a very graphical interface known as `gvim` and KDE offers `kvim`

### Emacs

- Unlike vi, `emacs` does not work with modes, it uses the Ctrl and Meta (Alt or Esc) keys for special commands
- `emacs` has many other capabilities other than simple text editing, such as email, debugging...
- The emacs tutorial is a good place to start learning basic commands. It is available any time when in emacs by simply typing `Ctrl-h` (for help) and then the letter `t` for tutorial.
