[Vundle plugin manager](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-vundle-to-manage-vim-plugins-on-a-linux-vps)

## My
```bash
"""" Enable Vundle: vim plugin manager

" disable compatibility mode with other distro "
set nocompatible
" disable filetype detection (but re-enable later, see below) "
"" filetype off   
" set the runtime path to include Vundle, and initialize "
"" set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
"" call vundle#begin() 
"" Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'
" enable syntax highlighting for rust "
"" Plugin 'wting/rust.vim' 
"" call vundle#end()         
 

"""" Basic Behavior
" show line numbers "
set number
" set encoding to UTF-8 (default was "latin1") "
set encoding=utf-8
" wrap lines "
set wrap      
set wrapmargin=4
" move vertically by visual line (don't skip wrapped lines) "
nmap j gj
nmap k gk
" When opening a new line and no filetype-specific indenting is enabled, keep the same indent as the line you're currently on. "
set nostartofline
" redraw screen only when we need to "
set lazyredraw  
" allows you to re-use the same window and switch from an unsaved buffer without saving it first. "
set hidden
" visual autocomplete for command menu "
set wildmenu
" highlight matching parentheses / brackets [{()}] "
set showmatch
" Show partial commands in the last line of the screen "
set showcmd
set cmdheight=2
" show line and column number of the cursor on right side of statusline "
set ruler
" enable mouse support (might not work well on Mac OS X) "
set mouse=a
" always show statusline (even with only single window) "
set laststatus=2
" blink cursor on error, instead of beeping "
set visualbell
" And reset the terminal code for the visual bell. "
set t_vb=
" Allow backspacing over autoindent, line breaks and start of insert action "
set backspace=indent,eol,start
" Instead of failing a command because of unsaved changes, instead raise an asking dialogue."
set confirm
" Quickly time out on keycodes, but never time out on mappings "
set notimeout ttimeout ttimeoutlen=200


"""" Vim Appearance

" put colorscheme files in ~/.vim/colors/ "
" good colorschemes: murphy, slate, molokai, badwolf, solarized "
colorscheme murphy      

" use filetype-based syntax highlighting, ftplugins, and indentation "
"" syntax on 
"OR use bellow which will keep your current color settings"
syntax enable
filetype plugin indent on


"""" Search Settings

" highlight matches "
set hlsearch
" search as characters are entered "
set incsearch     
" Use case insensitive search, except when using capital letters "
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" turn off search highlighting with <CR> (carriage-return) "
nnoremap <CR> :nohlsearch<CR><CR>



"""" Tab settings

" width that a <TAB> character displays as "
set tabstop=4   
" convert <TAB> key-presses to spaces "        
set expandtab     
" number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent "      
set shiftwidth=4  
" backspace after pressing <TAB> will remove up to this many spaces "      
set softtabstop=4       
" copy indent from current line when starting a new line "
set autoindent          
" even better autoindent (e.g. add indent after '{') "
set smartindent     


"""" Clipboard

" No register name for clipboard if the vim has a clipboard (`vim --version|grep clipboard` to verify) "
set clipboard=unnamedplus
" Use <F11> to toggle between 'paste' and 'nopaste' "
set pastetoggle=<F11>
" Map Y to act like D and C, i.e. to yank until EOL, rather than act as yy, which is the default " 
"" map Y y$


"""" Auto Complete Braces
" Automatically closing braces "
inoremap {<CR> {<CR>}<Esc>ko<tab>
inoremap [<CR> [<CR>]<Esc>ko<tab>
inoremap (<CR> (<CR>)<Esc>ko<tab>


"""" Miscellaneous settings that might be worth enabling

" highlight current line "
"" set cursorline  
" configure Vim to use brighter colors "       
"" set background=dark  
" autoreload the file in Vim if it has been changed outside of Vim "  
"" set autoread           

```
