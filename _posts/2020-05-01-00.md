- Printing itself requires software that converts information from the application you are using to a language your printer can understand. The Linux standard for printing software is the `Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS)`.

- `CUPS` is the underlying software almost all Linux systems use to print from applications like a web browser or LibreOffice. It converts page descriptions produced by your application (put a paragraph here, draw a line there, and so forth) and then sends the information to the printer. It acts as a print server for both local and network printers.

- Printers manufactured by different companies may use their own particular print languages and formats. `CUPS` uses a modular printing system which accommodates a wide variety of printers and also processes various data formats. This makes the printing process simpler; you can concentrate more on printing and less on how to print.

- `CUPS` carries out the printing process with the help of its various components: 

```bash

Configuration Files --> Sheduler
                        |     |
                  Job File   Log File
                        |
                    Filter --> PPD Filter --> Backend --> Printer
```

- **Scheduler**: manages print jobs, handles administrative commands, allows users to query the printer status, and manages the flow of data through all CUPS components.

- **Configuration Files**: The print scheduler reads server settings from several configuration files, two most important art `cupsd.conf` and `printers.conf`. These and all other CUPS related configuration files are stored under the `/etc/cups/` directory.

  - `cupsd.conf` is where most system-wide settings are located; it does not contain any printer-specific details. Most of the settings available in this file relate to network security, i.e. which systems can access CUPS network capabilities, how printers are advertised on the local network, what management features are offered, and so on.

  - `printers.conf` is where you will find the printer-specific settings. For every printer connected to the system, a corresponding section describes the printerâ€™s status and capabilities. This file is generated or modified only after adding a printer to the system, and should not be modified by hand.

- **Job Files**: CUPS stores print requests as files under the `/var/spool/cups` directory. *Data files (Print queues)* are prefixed with the letter `d` while *control files* are prefixed with the letter `c`.

- **Log Files**: Log files are placed in `/var/log/cups` and are used by the scheduler to record activities that have taken place. These files include: *access, error, and page records*.

- **Filters, Printer Drivers, and Backends**: `CUPS` uses *filters* to convert job file formats to printable formats. *Printer drivers* contain descriptions for currently connected and configured printers, and are usually stored under `/etc/cups/ppd/`. The print data is then sent to the *printer* through a *filter*, and via a *backend* that helps to locate devices connected to the system.

### Managing CUPS

```bash
systemctl status cups
sudo systemctl <enable|disable> cups
sudo systemctl <start|stop|restart> cups
```

### Configuring a Printer from the GUI

- Make sure the device is currently turned on and connected to the system;
- If so it should show up in the printer selection menu (`Settings` - `Printers`);
- If the printer is not visible, you may want to troubleshoot using tools that will determine if the printer is connected. For common USB printers, for example, the `lsusb` utility will show a line for the printer. Extra software is rarely required.

### Adding Printers from the CUPS Web Interface

- A fact that few people know is that CUPS also comes with its own web server, which makes a configuration interface available via a set of CGI scripts.

- This web interface allows you to:

  - Add and remove local/remote printers
  - Configure printers:
    - Local/remote printers
    - Share a printer as a CUPS server
  - Control print jobs:
  - Monitor jobs
  - Show completed or pending jobs
  - Cancel or move jobs.
- The CUPS web interface is available on your browser at: <http://localhost:631>.

- Some pages require a username and password to perform certain actions, for example to add a printer. For most Linux distributions, you must use the root password to add, modify, or delete printers or classes.
