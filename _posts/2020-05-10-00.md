## Configuration

### Part 4

- No configuration excersice

### Part 5

- To verify whether a router is working.
- To check ROAS on the router.
- 

### Tips for Configuration

- Router CLI commands are similar to Switches, but a couple of topics do work differently, as follows:
  - The configuration of IP addresses differs in some ways, with *switches using a VLAN interface* and *routers using an IP address configured on each working interface*.
  - *Many Cisco router models have an auxiliary (Aux) port*, intended to be connected to an external modem and phone line to allow remote users to dial in to the router, and access the CLI, by making a phone call. *Cisco switches do not have auxiliary ports*.
  - *Router IOS defaults to disallow both Telnet and SSH into the router* because of the typical router default setting of `transport input none` in vty configuration mode. *Cisco Catalyst LAN switches typically default to allow both Telnet and SSH.*

```bash
# Part 5

show ip interface brief
show protocols [type] [number]
show interfaces [type] [number]

show interfaces
show ip route

show interfaces trunk

show interfaces [type] [number] switchport

ip address [address] [musk]  # connected routes
ip route                     # static routes

ip address [address] [musk] encapsulation dot1q [vlan-id] native

channel-group
no switchport

```
