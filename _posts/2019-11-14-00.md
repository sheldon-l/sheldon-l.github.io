- `.bashrc` is filled with Command Lines. The Command Lines in `.bashrc` will be exacuted whenerver a `shell` is opened or you manually start it with `source ~/.bashrc`. 
  - Tips: `shell`
    - In Linux, every process is running in a `shell`, no matter it's a GUI or a Command Line Terminal.

- `.bash_aliases` is a user defined list, which lists all short and convenient aliases for common used CMLs.

- `.bash_profile` is simmilar to `.bashrc`, but only holds **temporarily** used Command Lines, you hope which only runs when you manually start with `source ~/.bash_profile`
   
  - Tip: What is environment `PATH` ?
    - `PATH` reffers to `environment variable` in an operating systems, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. 
    - System will search files in your current path or in the `PATH` you set in your envirenment.

- `.bashrc`, `.bash_aliases`, and `.bash_profile` are all located in user's home dir.
  
    ```bash
    # open and edit `~/.bashrc`
    vim ~/.bashrc

    # open and edit `~/.bash_aliases`
    vim ~/.bash_aliases

    # open and edit `~/.bash_profile`
    vim ~/.bash_profile
    ``` 

## `~/.bashrc`

- Common CML used in `~/.bashrc` is defining a path's shortcut, environment `PATH`, and some preprocessing before a shell runs:
    ```bash
    # add a path shortcut
    export PathName=/user_dir
    # add a sub path shortcut under a parent path
    export SubPathName=$ParentPathName/sub_dir
    # add a new path to system's `PATH` (also called `environment variable`) after installing a software
    export PATH=/dir_of_a_new_software_bin:$PATH  # must be named `PATH`

    # restart terminal
    ```


## `~/.bash_aliases`
- An alias item can be a single line start with `alias`, or can be a block start with function, and quoted with `{}`
    ```bash
    # can be a single line start with `alias`
    alias sthstart='systemctl start sth'
    alias la='ls -a'

    # or can be a block start with function, and quoted with `{}`
    function apt-updater {
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade -Vy
        sudo apt autoremove -y
        sudo apt autoclean
        sudo apt clean
    }

    function v2-LA {
        sudo cp /dir/jsonfile /etc/v2ray/config.json
        sudo systemctl restart v2ray
        systemctl status v2ray
    }

    function quickpush {
        git add .
        git commit -m 'default quick push'
        git push
    }

    # restart terminal
    ```

## `~/.bash_profile`
- Common CML used in `~/.bashrc` is temporarily environment `PATH`, you should manually start it with `source ./bash_profile` everytime you want to use these `PATH`s.

```bash
# add to `~/.bash_profile`
export PATH=/dir_of_a_new_software_bin:$PATH

# run manually
source ./bash_profile
```
