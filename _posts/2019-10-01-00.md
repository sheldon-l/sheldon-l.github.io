```bash
# Open mysql by root
mysql -u root -p
# Tip: don't left over ';' in following sql langage

# Authorize a new user at localhost
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY ‘root_password‘;

# Instead, connect to remote MySQL:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO root@ip_adress IDENTIFIED BY ‘root_password‘ WITH GRANT OPTION;

# Check all users, several options:
select * from mysql.user;
select user, password, host from mysql.user;
desc mysql.user;
