## What is Linux

- Linux is the operating system kernel, which started by the boot loader, which itself started by the BIOS/UEFI;
- Ensures coordination between hardware and software, including managing hardware, processing, users, permissions, and the file system;
- Provides common base to all programs, runs in `ring zero` (`kernel space`); 
- Everything out kernel is `user space`;

## Linux History

- [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix): [Solaris](Solaris_(operating_system)), AIX, HP-UX

- [Berkeley Software Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution): [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD), [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29)

- [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux): Fedora, Debian, CentOS, OpenSUSE

## The boot process, init and Services;;

`Power On` - `BIOS` - `MBR (First Sector of the Hard Disk)` - `Boot Loader` - `Kernel` - `initramfs` - `/sbin/init` - `Shell by getty` - `(X Windows System) GUI`

- `/sbin/init`:

  - Traditionally, `/sbin/init` is serial processes `SysVinit`, did not easily take advantage of the *parallel processing*. Some modern methods, such as the use of containers, can require almost instantaneous startup times. Thus, systems now require methods with faster and enhanced capabilities

  - `Upstart` Developed by Ubuntu and first included in 2006; Adopted in Fedora 9 (in 2008) and in RHEL 6 and its clones.

  - `systemd` Adopted by Fedora first (in 2011); Adopted by RHEL 7 and SUSE; Replaced Upstart in Ubuntu 16.04; Replaced `Upstart` in Ubuntu 16.04. It has been adopted by the major distributions

  - `/sbin/init` now just points to `/lib/systemd/systemd`;

```bash
sudo systemctl start|stop|restart nfs.service
sudo systemctl enable|disable nfs.service
```

## Partitions and Filesystems

- A partition is a physically contiguous section of a disk, or what appears to be so in some advanced setups.

- A filesystem is a method of storing/finding files on a hard disk (usually in a partition). 

- File systems are prominent aspect of the kernel.
  - Unix-like systems:
    - merge all the file stores into a single hierarchy, which allows users and applications to access data by knowing its location within that hierarchy: `/`, `/home/user_name`, `/home/user_name/Desktop/file.txt`
  - Linux:
    - possesses only one such hierachy, and the others `mount` on directories in the hierarchy, then available under the `mount point`, allow storing user's `/home/` on a seperate hard disk, once you mount the disk on `/home`, these directories become accessible and keep working.
- There are many file system formats:
  - `VFAT` used by DOS and Windows, and the hard disk is accessible under Linux;
  - `NFS`: network filesystems;
  - `ext2`, `ext3`, `ext4` are widely used in Linux:
    - Formating command: '`mkfs.ext3`' (Make FileSystem)

### Debian Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

- Kernel exports data about detected hardware through the `/proc/` and `/sys/` virtual file systems;
- Applications often access devices by way of files created whithin `/dev/`:
  - partitions: `/dev/sda1`;
  - mice: `/dev/input/mouse0`;
  - keyboards: `/dev/input/event0`;
  - sound cards: `/dev/snd/*`;
  - serial ports: `/dev/ttyS*`;

- There are two types of device files:
  - `block`: has finit size, can access at any position, e.g. disk drives and partitions;
  - `character`: like a flow of characters, can read and write, but cannot seek to a given position and change arbitrary bytes, e.g. mouse, keyboard, serial ports;

  ```bash
  ls -l /dev/sda /dev/ttyS0
  # results:
  # brw-rw---- 1 root disk    8,  0 Apr 21 07:43 /dev/sda     # b for block
  # crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 Apr 21 07:43 /dev/ttyS0   # c for character

  file /dev/sda*
  file /dev/snd/*
  ```

- The File System:

  - `/bin/` - basic programs (ls, cd, cat, ...)
  - `/boot/` - kernel and other files required for early boot process
  - `/etc/` - configuration files
  - `/home/user_name` - user's personal files, application configuration files are often stored directly as `~/.dotfiles`
  - `/lib/` - basic libraries
  - `/media/*` - mount points for removable devices
  - `/mnt/` - temporary mount point
  - `/opt/` - extra applications provided by third parties
  - `/root/` - administrator's personal files
  - `/run/` - volatile runtime data (not yet included in th FHS)
  - `/sbin/` - system programs (fdisk, mkfs, sysctl, ...)
  - `/srv/` - data used by servers hosted on this system
  - `/temp/` - temporary files (typically deleted on boot)
  - `/usr/`:
    - `/usr/bin/`/`/usr/sbin/`/`/usr/lib/` - same logic as in the `/`
    - `/usr/share/` - application support and data files
    - `/usr/local/` - used by the administrator for installing applications manually without overwriting files handled by dt packaging system (`dpkg`)
  - `/var/` - variable data handled by daemons, including log, queues, spools, and caches
  - `/proc/` and `/sys/` - specific to the Linux kernel, not part of the FHS, used by the kernel for exporting data to user space.

```bash
tree -aCd -L 1 /
tree -aCd -L 1 /usr
tree -aCd -L 2 /home
tree -aCd -L 1 /var
```

## Software

- Common applications (such as the Firefox web browser and LibreOffice office suite)
- Developer tools (like the `vi` and `emacs` text editors)
- Popular services, (such as the Apache web server tools or MySQL database)
- Desktop (such as `GNOME` or `KDE`)
- All installers set up some initial security features on the new system. One basic step consists of setting the password for the superuser (root) and setting up an initial user. In some cases (such as Ubuntu), only an initial user is set up; direct root login is not configured and root access requires logging in first as a normal user and then using `sudo`. 
- Some distributions will also install more advanced security frameworks, such as `SELinux` or `AppArmor`. For example, all Red Hat-based systems including Fedora and CentOS always use `SELinux` by default, and Ubuntu comes with `AppArmor` up and running.

## Install Source

- Many installers can do an installation completely automatically, using a configuration file to specify installation options. This file is called a `Kickstart file` for Red Hat-based systems, an `AutoYAST profile` for SUSE-based systems, and a `Preseed file` for Debian-based systems.

## Managing Processes

- Unix-like systems, kernel devides CPU (1 core, 1 thread) time into small slice and run each inturn. processes identified by process identification (`PID`). Processes also idetified by the user who started it.

```bash
ps aux
ps -ef
ps -fC [command_name]

kill -[signal] [pid] # force kill
term [pid]           # terminate gracefully

# Ctrl + c : cancel process
# Ctrl + z : pauses the process and wait in background

jobs -l # jobs running in the background

fg %[job-number]  # restores a job to the foreground
bg %[job-number]  # restarted in the background
kill %[job-number]
```

## Managing Permissions

- Linux is a multi-user system so it is necessary to provide a permissions system to control the set of authorized operations on files and directories, which includes all the system resources and devices.
  - Types of users: `u`, `g`, `o` = owner, oner group, others
  - Types of rights: `r`, `w`, `x` = read, write, execute, `X` applies only to directories

- SECURITY: `setuid` and `setgid` executables
  - Two particular rights are relevant to executable files: `setuid` and `setgid` (symbolized with the letter “`s`”). 
  - These two rights allow any user to execute the program with the rights of the owner or the group, respectively. 
  - This mechanism grants access to features requiring higher level permissions than those you would usually have.
  - Since a `setuid` root program is systematically run under the super-user identity, it is very important to ensure it is secure and reliable. 
  - Any user who manages to subvert a `setuid` root program to call a command of their choice could then impersonate the root user and have all rights on the system. 
  - Penetration testers regularly search for these types of files when they gain access to a system as a way of escalating their privileges.

- A directory is handled differently from a file. 
  - Read access gives the right to consult the list of its contents (files and directories); 
  - Write access allows creating or deleting files;
  - Execute access allows crossing through the directory to access its contents (for example, with the `cd` command). Being able to cross through a directory without being able to read it gives the user permission to access the entries therein that are known by name, but not to find them without knowing their exact name.

- SECURITY: `setgid` directory and `sticky bit`
  - The `setgid` bit also applies to directories. 
  - Any newly-created item in such directories is automatically assigned the owner group of the parent directory, instead of inheriting the creator’s main group as usual. Because of this, you don’t have to change your main group (with the `newgrp` command) when working in a file tree shared between several users of the same dedicated group.
  - The `sticky` bit (symbolized by the letter “`t`”) is a permission that is only useful in directories. 
  - It is especially used for temporary directories where everybody has write access (such as `/tmp/`): it restricts deletion of files so that only their owner or the owner of the parent directory can delete them.

- Changing the user and group

```bash
chown [user]:[group] [file]
chgrp [group] [file]
chmod [rights] [file]
```

- There are two ways of representing rights

```bash
# Opt1. Symbolic representation
chmod [-R] [a|<u><g><o>][-|+|=][<w><r><x|X>] [file] # -R = Recursive, a = ugo
chmod -R a+X [directory]

# Opt2. The (octal) numeric representation
chmod 467 [file]
# The most frequent right combinations are 755 for executable files and directories, and 644 for data files.
chmod 4467 [file]  # add bit 4, Granting Temporary Root User’s Permissions with `setuid`
chmod 2467 [file]  # add bit 2, Granting Temporary Root User’s Permissions with `setgid`
chmod 1467 [file]  # add bit 1, Granting Temporary Root User’s Permissions with `sticky`
# The use of octal notation only allows you to set all the rights at once on a file
umask # will see a mask such as 0022, used to restrict permissions on newly created files
```

- Users and Groups
  - `/etc/passwd` - list of users
  - `/etc/shadow` - encrypted passwords for users
  - `/etc/group` - list of groups
  - `/etc/gshadow` - encrypted passwords for groups

```bash
getent passwd [user]   # return the information from the user database

adduser [user]
adduser [user] [group] # conf file in /etc/adduser.conf
passwd [user]          # updates the /etc/shadow
chfn [user]            # CHange Full Name
chsh [user]            # CHange SHell among /etc/shells
chage [user]           # CHange passwd AGE
chage -l [user]        # list passwd age
passwd -e [user]       # forces the user to change their password
passwd -<l|u> [user]   # lock/unlock
<addgroup|delgroup> [group]
groupmod
gpasswd [group]        # change
gpasswd -r [group]     # remove
```

## Basic Commands

### Getting Help - `man`, `apropos`, `--help`

- `man [pages]` Divided into following sections:
  - User commands
  - Programming interfaces for kernel system calls
  - Programming interfaces to the C library
  - Special files such as device nodes and drivers
  - File formats
  - Miscellaneous
  - System administration commands

```bash
man ls
man passwd
man -k passwd       # -k: key word, will return section of a key word
man -k `^passwd$`
man 5 passwd        # 5: the section returned by above command

apropos passwd      # equivalent to `man -k [pages]`
apropos partition

uname --help
```

### GNOME Terminal

- Lunix widely use GNOME Terminal, accessible by `Ctrl + Alt + F1 (or F2) ~ F6 (or F7)` , `Ctrl` can be omitted if you are already in text mode;

### Other

- See [Linux 7 - Basic Operation For Debian-liked System](https://tane-rs.github.io/2019/10/29/00.html)


### Browsing the Directory Tree and Managing Files

```bash
# Displaying
cat [file_name]
less [file_name]
more [file_name]


# list
ls
ls -al


# Moving around
cd
pwd


# Creating/Removing Directoris
mkdir [dir_name1] [dir_name2]
rm -rf [dir_name1]/ [dir_name2]/

mkdir ["dir name"]
rmdir ["dir name"]

rm -rf ["dir name"]/
# OR
rm -rf [dir\ name]/

mkdir -p [dir_name]/{sub_dir1,sub_dir2,sub_dir3}
ls -l [dir_name]/


# copy and move
cp [source_file] [target_file]
mv [source_file] [target_file]


# Finding Files
locate [file]   # just search in `locate.db` updated by `corn`

which [file]    # return $PATH
echo $PATH

find [directory] [criteria]     # most complex and flexible
sudo find / -name sbd*

grep -r [expression] [files]    # -r: enables a recursive search

type rm
type cd

time [command] # timing
time find [directory] [criteria]
time locate [file]
```

### SSH Service

```bash
# start
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo ss -antlp | grep sshd

sodo systemctl enable ssh
```

### HTTP Service

- Often used in penetration

```bash
# start
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo ss -antlp | grep apache2

sodo systemctl enable apache2
```

### List All Available Services

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files

lsof -i -P -n
```

### APT Packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt upgrade [package]

apt-cashe search [package]
apt show [package]

sudo apt install [package]

sudo apt remove --purge [package]
```

### `dpkg`

- `dpkg` is the core tool to install a package `.deb`, either directly or indirectly through APT.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i [package.deb]

sudo dpkg -r [package.deb]
```

## Command Line

- See help doc in `man [command]` for more detail
- See [Linux 7 - Useful Commands For Debian-liked System](https://tane-rs.github.io/2019/10/29/00.html) for more examples

### Environment Variables

- Can be defined system-wide in `/etc/profile` or user's `~/.profile`, but variables that are not specific to command line interpreters are better put in `/etc/environment`, since those variables will be injected into all user sessions thanks to a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) even when no shell is executed.

```bash
# display
echo $PATH
echo $PWD
echo $HOME
echo $USER

echo "$$"   # process ID

# define variables 
# available to any subprocesses spawn from current bash.
export all_proxy=socks5:127.0.0.1:1080

export address=10.11.1.120
ping -c 2 $address


# define variables
# only available in current shell
var="My Var"
echo "$$"
echo $var   # "My Var"

# new a bash and the process ID
bash
echo "$$"
echo $var   # Nonthing
exit


# default `env`
env
```

### History

```bash
cat /etc/lsb-release
history
clear
history
!1      # case 1 in history

sudo systemctl restart apache2
!!      # repeat last one

echo $HISTSIZE      # number of history in memory
echo $HISTFILESIZE  # number of history in history file
vim ~/.bashrc       # edit env vars

# # Search in history
# J: scroll backwards
# L: scroll forwards
# Ctrl + r: revers-i-search, match history according to your typing 
```

### Piping and Redirection

- Every program run from the command line has three data stream connected to it that serve as communication channels with the external environment. These streams are defined as:

  Stream Name | Description
  -|-
  STDIN | Data fed into the program
  STDOUT | Output from the program (default to terminal)
  STDERR | Err messages (default to terminal)


- Piping: `|`

- Redirecting: `<` and `>`

```bash
## STDIN
# redirecting to new file
ls
echo "test"
echo "test" > redirection_test.txt
ls
cat redirection_test.txt
echo "Kali Linux is an open source project" > redirection_test.txt
cat redirection_test.txt

# redirecting to an existing file
echo "that is maintained and funded by Offensive Security" >> redirection_test.tx
cat redirection_test.txt

## STDOUT
# redirecting from a file
wc -m < redirection_test.txt   
# redirection_test.txt is STDIN
# output (char count) is STDOUT

## STDERROR
ls ./not_exist 2>> error.txt   # 2: don't print err in screen
cat error.txt

## Piping
cat error.txt | wc -m > count.txt
cat count.txt
```

### Text Searching and Manipulating

```bash
# grep
ls -la /usr/bin | grep zip

# sed
echo "I need to try hard" | sed 's/hard/harder/'

# cut
echo "I hack binaries, web apps, mobile apps" | cut -f 2 -d ","
cat /etc/passwd
cut -d ":" -f 1 /etc/passwd

# awk
echo "hello::there::friend" | awk -F "::" '{print $1 $3}'
echo "hello::there::friend" | awk -F "::" '{print $1, $3}'


# practical example
gunzip access_log.txt.gz
mv access_log.txt access.log    # a long log
head access.log                 # check head, like following
```
```

# sort -u : sort and unique

```

### Editing Files

- nano

- vi

- [vim](https://tane-rs.github.io/2019/12/05/00.html)

### Comparing Files

```bash
# comm
comm scan_a.txt scan_b.txt  # unique in a, unique in b, common in ab
comm -12 scan_a.txt scan_b.txt  # only common in ab

# diff
diff -c scan_a.txt scan_b.txt
diff -u scan_a.txt scan_b.txt

# vimdiff
vimdiff scan_a.txt scan_b.txt  # open vim with multiple files
```

### Monitoring File and Command

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log

watch -n 5 w
```

### Downloading Files

```bash
wget
curl
axel #download accelerator that transfers a file from a FTP or HTTP server through multiple connections
```
