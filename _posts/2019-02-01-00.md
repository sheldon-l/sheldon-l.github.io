### Associate your Git with Github.

1. Sign up a Github account, and learn how to manipulate your account and repo. See [Github Tutor](../common/github-tutor.md) for details.

2. Install an editor which can edit `markdown`(`.md`): such as `Atom`, `VS Code`, ...

3. Install `Git`, configure your account the same as your Github, and interact with github. See [Git Tutor](../common/git-tutor.md) for details.

### Create and Configure your Github Page (Understood as Root/Master/Home).

1. Create a new repo named as `YourAccountName.github.io`, **with a `README` in it**.

2. Go to this repo setting, finde the botton `Choose theme`, `Select` a theme you like.

3. Back to repo, you'll see a new file named `_config.yml`. Open and add new configs:

    ```markdown
    title: Your Title
    description: Your Description
    ```

4. Create a file `index.md`. You can edit it. It will show as:

    ```
    https://YourAccountName.github.io
    ```

5. Then, **you or your collaborator** can clone it to devices.

### Create and Configure your Sub Project which can be shown as website (gh-pages).

1. Create a new repo named as you like.

2. Go to the repo, you will see a pulldown of `Branch: master`. Click it and input: `gh-pages`, and click `create new branch: gh-pages` when you finish your typing.

3. Find the tag `n branch` (n may be 2) and click.

4. Set `gh-pages`as default.

5. Go to this repo setting, finde the `Github Pages` block, change the source option to `gh-pages`.

6. Select a theme and config it as above.

7. Create a file `index.md`. You can edit it. It will show as:
    
    ```
    https://YourAccountName.github.io/ProjectName
    ```

8. Then, **you or your collaborator** can clone it to devices.


### How to Publish Blog

If you want to create a `hello` page: 

1. Choose the right repo (Home or any gh-pages). Creat `helloFolder/hello.md` and write anything you want (See [Markdown Tutor](../common/markdown-tutor.md)). 

2. Add a link in `index.md`:

```markdown    
[hello world](helloFolder/hello.md)
```

3. You can decorate your page with:

```markdown   
[HOME](https://YourAccountName.github.io/)

[BACK](../)

![Image](someFolder/someImage.png) 
<!--Search "relative path" and "absolute path" if you feel confused.--> 
<!--
For a better display, there's a way to prepare images before uploading:
    1. Choose the images you like, zoom in or out when fit the size you want.
    2. Use screenshot tool to crop all images with the same width (I like 580 px)
    3. save them as imagName.png
-->

This page was last updated at {{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" }}.
<!--Show updated time.-->
```

### How to Maintain Your Publish

1. Edit it. Synchronize.

2. If you **rename the file**, you should remember **redirect all the links to this file**. So, it should be very cautious when you name or rename a file. **Design First!** Be decisive, not fickle.
