## Installation

### For Debian

- For Debian or Ubuntu, see [MySQL Community Server (for APT)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-apt-repo-quick-guide/en/);

- After installation, see [Postinstallation Setup and Testing](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/postinstallation.html)

- For all tutorials: [MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/)

### For CentOS

- For CentOS MariaDB Database (a fork of MySQL for RedHat Enterprise Linux) is default;

- If still want MySQL for _CentOS 7_ or _RedHat 7_, refer to [MySQL Community Server (for Yum)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-repo-excerpt/8.0/en/linux-installation-yum-repo.html);

__Tip: remember the root passwd__

```bash
# Check if installed already
rpm -qa | grep mysql

# !! this line won't install mysql, but update Mariadb, for Mariadb is default for CentOS
yum install mysql

# !! remove Mariadb first
yum remove mysql

# Download mysql repo source and install
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm
sudo yum localinstall mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm

# Check if mysql's yum repo is got
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
ls
# OR
yum repolist enabled | grep "mysql.*-community.*"
# Return:
# 'mysql-community.repo'
# 'mysql-community-source.repo'

# Install mysql server
sudo yum install mysql-community-server
# This installs the package for MySQL server (mysql-community-server) 
# and also packages for the components required to run the server, 
# including packages for the client (mysql-community-client), 
# the common error messages and character sets for client and server (mysql-community-common), 
# and the shared client libraries (mysql-community-libs). 

# Check
rpm -qa | grep mysql

# Starting the MySQL Server 
service mysqld start

# Get temperary passwd and set root's passwd and set a custom password for the superuser account
sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
mysql -uroot -p
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass4!'; # ';' is a must!

# Relogin to check

# Allow service mysql (mariadb) through firewall.
firewall-cmd --add-service=mysql
# Secure mysql (mariadb) server
/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
```

### Iinstall MySQL on Client

Same as on server.


## Get Started

```bash
# Open mysql by root
mysql -u root -p
# Tip: don't left over ';' in following sql langage

# Authorize a new user at localhost
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY ‘root_password‘;

# Instead, connect to remote MySQL:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO root@ip_adress IDENTIFIED BY ‘root_password‘ WITH GRANT OPTION;

# Check all users, several options:
select * from mysql.user;
select user, password, host from mysql.user;
desc mysql.user;

```
